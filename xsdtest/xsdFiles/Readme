The mxGraph.xsd is create from the XcosFile.xsd.

All the elements of the format 
<element name="mxXYZ".../> 
have been included. 

Used the ports.html example to create a graph with high complexity and checked for validity using Scilab function. 

Needed to add following items manually:

1. 
<element name="mxRectangle".../>
2.
attribute name="target" in mxCell element to cope up with the edges.
